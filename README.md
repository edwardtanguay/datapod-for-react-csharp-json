## commands

-   `npm run pd` - **parse data** - _convert flashcards.txt into flashcards.json_
-   `npm run cp` - **create page** - _not yet implemented_
-   `npm run learn 001` - **learn examples** - _run example 001_
-   `npm run learn 002` - **learn examples** - _run example 002_

## Compatibility

-   ✔️ tested on Windows
-   ✔️ tested on Ubuntu

## Editor

-   it is recommended to use VSCode which has the best C# support
-   it seems Microsoft doesn't allow e.g. Trae to use certain C# tools which leads to it reporting that internal classes don't have certain methods, etc.
